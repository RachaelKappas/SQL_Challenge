# SQL_Challenge
Module 9 Challenge 

I added the code that I created using Postgresql using PGAdmin. I was not sure if I needed to add the actual files of my results. I didnt see that specified in the instructions. Please let me know if this is necessary or if just the code that I used to create the results was needed.
